#### Executive Summary
In this proposal, we researched the geological approaches in the mineral detection. With our understanding of the drillhole database, other internal data sources, external hydrochemical data and soil type data gathered from SARIG, we used boosting algorithms to predict the top 10 gold and copper deposits in the Mount Woods Area. Furthermore, used Gaussian Process Regression to validate the top sites we predicted. Lastly, we conducted risk analysis and a feasibility study to validate our selections.
